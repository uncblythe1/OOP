An essay on Object-Oriented Programming  
Object-Oriented Programming  

What is it?
    Object-oriented programming (OOP) is a form of programming that uses objects as the primary means of organizing a program.  It can be implemented in a vast array of technical languages.  The main way in which OOP works is to break down the program into many smaller pieces so that each individual piece may manage its own state.  Using OOP, programmers are able to keep problems with specific units contained.  It is easier to correct and update individual units so that other areas of a program are not affected.  The different pieces are created with objects.  The methods and properties that make up their interface are public (open to outside code) and others are private (kept within the unit).   The method of separating public vs. private properties is called encapsulation.  The OOP-‘heavy’ languages include Java, C++, C#, Common Lisp, Dart, Object Pascal, Objective-C, Perl, PHP, Python, Scala, Smalltalk, and Swift.  

   Inheritance is the idea that one object or class is based on that of another.  Forms of inheritance include either classes or prototypes.  The more common types of OOP languages are class-based.  The objects are considered instances of classes, which usually defines their type.  Classes define the data format and available procedures (class methods) for a specific type or group of objects.  An example of this would be an object with a name field (aka variable) set to ‘Leonidas’(my puppy) might be an instance of the class ‘g97wd_aus dogs’.  Object property names must be strings.  However, JavaScript does come with a class, Map, that allows any type of keys.  Ex from Eloquent JavaScript:    The set, get, and has are methods that belong to the interface of the Map object.
	
The Why.  

OOP is often used by programmers who want to work on the same project but don’t want to get in each other’s way.  Some advantages include:  

>Modularity:  compartmentalizes programs by defining datatypes, hiding implementation, and defining an interface.  
>Scale:  programmers working on a project do not have to know the entire projects code.  
>Maintenance:  Can create new objects with minor differences to old objects.  OOP is often used when a lot of changes are expected to happen over time.  
>Extensibility:  A project can easily be extended w/libraries where components can be modified to suit the needs of the program.  
>Hardware resources:  it is often more cost effective to have different hardware resources for each module.  
>Reusable:  the individual modules work by themselves and do not have to remain solely w/in the project it was created.  They can be used for other projects.  Best when you have a lot of code to be shared and reused.
